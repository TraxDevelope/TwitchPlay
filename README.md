# TwitchPlays 1.0

Hello everybody, today i created a Twitch Play script.
Hope this helped you and have a nice day.

The code requires entry of your OAuth Code, Twitch Channel, and Owner Account.
You will have to download AutoHotkey at the link below: https://www.autohotkey.com/
Remember where you download AutoHotkey to!
You will need to provide the file directory address of where the AutoHotkey.exe file is to run the script properly!

Additional information for the AHK Python wrapper module used can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/ahk/
